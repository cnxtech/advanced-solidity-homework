# Puppercoin Crowdsale

The following code creates an ERC20 token that will be minted through a Crowdsale contract that can be leveraged from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.  This crowdsale contract will manage the entire process, allowing users to send ETH and get back PUP (PupperCoin).  This contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.  The Crowdsale is required to enable refunds if successful and the goal is met, which is a maximum of 300 Ether.  The crowdsale will run for 24 weeks.
